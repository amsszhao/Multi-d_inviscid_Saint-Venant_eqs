## Description 

### point_roll.m

This is the main file. It realizes the computation of the periodic Evans-Lopatinsky determinant of a roll wave train with Froude number F and minimum fluid height Hm and various other functions.

### compute_static_mat.m compute_W.m interior_ode.m

These are supportive files of the main file point_roll.m.


### extract_sub.m

This function helps to coordinate parallel computation and will extract useful stability info.

### other files

There are many other files realizing all sorts of computations made in the manuscipt. We omits their descriptions.
